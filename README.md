# RATIONALE #

* This internal project reflects our needs to digitize analogous data to the digital realm.
* There were some insights and failures in the process, but, we reached the goal: not too pricey, technically affordable and easy to transport and deploy.
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time
